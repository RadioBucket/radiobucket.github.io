####Like you we’re passionate about club and dance music and that’s exactly what you will hear on Paul FM. We focus on the genres and sub genres that make up dance music from the last three decades. If you've heard it on the dance floor, at music festivals or on that clubbing holiday to Ibiza, you will hear it on Paul FM. Our output includes commercial dance, progressive house, deep house, uplifting, electronic and trance music from 1990 to the present day.
